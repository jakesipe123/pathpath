      “Tears were dripping onto my dress, but I wasn't making any sound. There was no sound to express thid kind of pain.
I didn't want to move, didn't want to do anything. Fang was not waiting for me out in the living room. Tomorrow morning, when I woke up, Fang would still be gone.”
― James Patterson, Fang
